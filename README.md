# Bench-for-Testing-Component

On these days, in any any idustral branch, it is difficult to succeed in a market that requires high quality of product and there is a strong competitive environment. For the succes in such a market, it is necessary to constantly innovate products and to follow modern trends. However, a great R&D team with bundle talented developers is not always sufficient to succeed. Innovations of manufacturing process and production tools that help to transform dreams of designers and developers into a real products, it is necessary to pay attention to them. Manufacturing process is not question of quality. An important value is the speed and time in which the machines and workers are able to produce the items and thus influence the price of the products.

The period of time that a workers or robots require to produce a part or assembly is influenced by several factors. For instance, the comfort of the working environment and task that can be easily understandable. It is therefore important to consider both aesthetics and practicality when designing assembly tools and equipment

This project aimed to design a simple test bench for testing the subassemblies. This subassembly contains several stepper motors and opto-electronic sensors. Second purpose of the bench is cilibration the sensors and such process must be done on  a complete darkness.

Various options were considered in the preliminary design. From a welded assembly, through an aluminum modular construction to a wooden material. Use of wood was rejected at the beginning due to the high dust levels and the risk of small particles breaking off which could negatively affect testing. Base on a fact that subassembly is designed for laboratory application and there is also a request for corrosion resistance. Unfortunately, the welded stainless steel assembly is too expensive. That is why the aluminum profile construction was chosen, which is complemented by carbon steel sheets with a corrosion-resistant surface.

The construction in the figure below consists of a separate table with a superstructure to which other functional table elements are mounted. We can also notice the superstructures in the lower part of the table, which contain controls, a power supply and a box with PCB boards. Yellow plate is made of plastic. The entire work area is covered with a two-piece hinged cover and a rear sliding cover. Since the parts of the hinged cover are not of the same length, it was necessary to design a mechanism that allows the greatest possible opening of the cover for convenient access. The rear doors are equipped with simple travels that allow up and down movement. Magnets are used for fixing in the upper position.
