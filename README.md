# Bench for Testing Component

These days, in any industrial branch, it is difficult to succeed in a market that requires high quality product and is influenced by a strong competitive environment. To be successful in such a market, it is necessary to constantly innovate products and to follow modern trends. However, a great R&D team with a group of talented developers is not always enough for success. Innovations of manufacturing process and production tools that help to turn the dreams of designers and developers into real products, it is necessary to pay attention to them. We  also need to acknowledge the importance of manufacturing and innovation tools that help turn the dreams of designers and developers into real products. Manufacturing isnâ€™t just a question of quality. An important value is the speed and time in which the machines and workers are able to produce the items and thus influence the price of the products.

The time that a worker or a robot requires to produce a part or an assembly is influenced by several factors. For instance, the comfort of the working environment and task that can be easily comprehensible. It is therefore important to consider both aesthetics and practicality when designing assembly tools and equipment.

This project aimed to design a simple test bench for testing the subassemblies. This subassembly contains several stepper motors and opto-electronic sensors. The other aim of the bench is calibrating the sensors, which has to be done in complete darkness 

Various options were considered in the preliminary design: from a welded assembly, through an aluminium modular construction to a wooden material. Using wood was rejected at the beginning due to high dust levels and the risk of small particles breaking off which could negatively affect testing. Since the subassembly is designed for laboratory application, we need to take into consideration corrosion resistance. Unfortunately, the welded stainless steel assembly is too expensive. That is why the aluminium profile construction was chosen, which is complemented by carbon steel sheets with a corrosion-resistant surface.

The construction in the figure below consists of a separate table with an extension to which other functional table elements are mounted. We can also notice the extensions in the lower part of the table, which contain controls, a power supply and a box with PCB boards. The yellow plate is made from (of) plastic. The entire work area is covered with a two-piece hinged cover and a rear sliding cover. Since the parts of the hinged cover are not of the same length, it was necessary to design a mechanism that allows the greatest possible opening of the cover for convenient access. The rear doors are equipped with simple pulleys that allow up and down movement. Magnets are used for fixing in the upper position.
